# Minimum issue requirements

**Search the issue tracker first, as it's very possible your question has been asked and answered**

Please provide, at minimum:
* Way Cooler version (obtained via `way-cooler --version`
* Init file
* Debug log

You can obtain a debug log like so: `way-cooler 2> log.txt`

If the error is a result of a segfault, please also include a backtrace or a coredump.

# Bonus information
If you provide this information as well, I can respond to your request much faster:
* Is the issue reproducible on Sway?
  - We share the same backend, so if it's not a Way Cooler specific issue it might affect them too
* What distro do you run?
* How did you install Way Cooler?
  - E.g: build from source? Package manager? Found on a disk by the side of the road?


# Awesome specific questions
If the bug report is an issue with the Awesome API, please mention the appropriate method/object from the Awesome Lua API and describe how it is not working as intended.
