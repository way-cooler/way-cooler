#Contributing to Way Cooler

We are always looking for more help to improve Way Cooler. Even if you don't know how to write any Rust code, we always need better documentation, detailed bug reports, and suggestions for more features.

Every pull request that adds new functionality / fixes a bug should have tests ensuring that the feature works / the bug can't happen again. If this isn't possible (for example it would require mocking wlc, something that is currently very difficult), exceptions can be made.
